## Planning

<br>

The Trello board has helped me to manage what I've done and what I have needed to do. I've kept it really basic so that I can't confuse myself or anyone who wants to view it.
I've also used my trello board to store my user stories. 

<br>

### User Stories
![User Stories](https://github.com/MattColemann72/random-animal/blob/dev/misc/User-stories.jpg)
My user stories describe what my webapp should do. This has been useful for me when I was programming the app so that I knew exactly what I wanted to achieve.
The user needs to be able to what animals they are merging together, the animal that has been created and finally the last 5 animal names that were generated.<br>With the briefness of the user stories I know that I need to generate 2 random animal names then merge the two of them into one name. Once this is done I know that I need to store the newly created names in a database so that I can show the previous 5 of them, then I can print the two names of the animals to the screen along with the made up animal name.

<br>

### ERD

The ERD for this project is very simple with it being just the one table. All I wanted to store was the made up name generated from the two animal names given. Like I have previously stated, I will then be able to grab the stored names to show them to the user.
